have tab buttons at the bottom of the window.
when a tab button is pressed, change the layout of items that are on the screen.
    ex) Data Input, View Stats, Settings.
        if any of these buttons are pushed, then change the objects that are on the screen.



save the data in the program everytime that the tabs are changed and when the program closes.

when the user enters the gamemode-stage-weapon-killl line, reset the dropdown menu option to the default.

connect all of the components that are used to denote the current gamemode-stage-weapon-kill as a single cohesive item. could try to make a class for this object in the GUI.


for the current status group of objects, I want the weapon dropDown to be dependent on the weaponType drop down. I think I could just create a general weaponDropDown, then whenever the weaponType drop down changes, change which dropDown is being used by the general weaponDropDown.
