* constructing structures from data files

when loading data for a weapon, the single line for the weapon data and the whole list of stages will be iterated through at the same time to line up with each other. 

for each game mode that is loaded into the program, it will contain a vector of stages. All stage names will be loaded first into the stage objects, then a single weapon will be loaded into all of the stages at once. loop until there are no more weapons to process. 

copy the stage names into a single vector, then copy this vector to the rest of the vectors that need to be filled. when constructing the data, keep a copy of a blank weapon vector and a blank stage vector with only the names added. delete the blank vectors when finished building the data structures. 





CURRENT PROGRESS AFTER A LONG BREAK:
    I remember having an issue in the tracker.cpp file with the constructor. Before any editing, the issue is right aroung line 330 in that file. There is something wrong the index accessing for vectors that are being manipulated.
